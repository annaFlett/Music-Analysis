TODO:
Add top 5 albums to the dropdown
Make it so that the calendar cannot go back past August or beyond where we are now
Sort out formatting for the table
Sort out fomrmatting for the calendar
Descriptions for graphs
Stop quick fact box changing size
Make slides unable to go past 10/90 for extreme handles
Try and sort out colouring on map so that count=1 countries look like they have been coloured in
Button formatting(esp add song / that dropdown -> make bigger) / General stylistic formatting
Fix the week splitting (make past 4 weeks from current point + change legend)
If can be bothered, make it so that you can change the range of the listening hours graph
better formatting on no songs selected / put in red error thing if they press button without selecting a song (or disable button might be better)


Taking things further:
maybe have a think about something to do with genres / song lengths
try and get more songs for the songDB to make recommendations from
add warnings when songs are selected which cannot be used in the recommender (cause they have no data) -> make sure if only one song
is picked and its missing data, that it doesn't break scikit
add auth so other people can use the site


Look into this with the csv files:
-> 2 in a row duplicates (maybe shows up once has been over the duration of the song?). Work out why this happens / how to remove the duplicates
-> Each morning seems to start with a song which was last o yeasterday (again, maybe has been longer than the duration of the song, so shows up). Check if this happens every day, 
and if it does delete first entry from every morning. -> doesn't happen everyday, seems to just be random
