TODO:


Taking things further:
maybe have a think about something to do with genres / song lengths
try and get more songs for the songDB to make recommendations from
add warnings when songs are selected which cannot be used in the recommender (cause they have no data) -> make sure if only one song
is picked and its missing data, that it doesn't break scikit
add auth so other people can use the site
Try and make the site work using databases rather than CSVs
